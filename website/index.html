        I am a junior at Harvey Mudd College (HMC) majoring in Computer Science
        and minoring in Economics. This summer (2023), I have interned at
        JPMorgan Chase as a software engineering fellow and conducted computer
        science-education research alongside a PhD student at the University of
        Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. During the school year, I work as a web
        developer for an HMC prof, augmenting his music website and building
        music quizzes for his classes. I also work part-time as a sports
        medicine aid for Claremont-Mudd-Scripps Athletics. Outside of work and
        school, I am the founder/president of the Latina Empowerment and
        Development (LEAD) Club at Mudd, and co-president of the Jam Society-a
        music club at Mudd. In my free time, I love writing songs, playing my
        guitar, and adding new photos to my instagram photography page!
      </p>

        Since middle school, I have developed a love of all things STEM and have
        saught out learning opportunities so I could grow in my STEM knowledge.
        In terms of career aspirations, I have an affinity for sports, medicine,
        computer science, and economics. I appreciate all four of these areas of
        study because they allow me to combine my fascination with science and
        my desire to help people. I look forward to exploring these different
        subjects more at Mudd in the coming years through classes and research
        opportunities!
      </p>

      <p>
        In conclusion, welcome to my website! I hope you enjoy exploring my
        code, blogs, and other passion projects!
